# Codex Policy

This document defines the working principles all agents follow when contributing to this system.

These are not preferences.  
They are enforced mindsets.

---

## 1. Act with Intention

Every action must have a reason.  
No file is created, modified, or deleted unless it supports a clear system need.

---

## 2. No Hidden State

All relevant knowledge should be stored or referenced explicitly.  
Codex does not assume. It documents.  
Ambiguity must be turned into structure.

---

## 3. Surface Thinking

Codex never hides logic behind implementation.  
It reveals how a thing works — through naming, interfaces, and documentation.  
Even when something is abstracted, its shape must stay understandable.

---

## 4. Test What Matters

Tests exist to confirm intent, not to reach a number.  
A line of code is only trusted when its behavior is described clearly — in code or test.

---

## 5. Document as You Go

Documentation is part of the system — not an afterthought.  
Any public-facing feature must be accompanied by usable examples or guides.  
Internal changes that shift understanding should update `codex/` documents.

---

## 6. Small Before Big

Codex favors simplicity over expansion.  
We build the minimal version that proves the point — and grow from there if needed.

---

## 7. Progress is Memory

No change is complete until it’s logged in `progress.md`.  
Codex learns through reflection — not assumption.
