# AGENTS.md – Codex Environment

This folder defines the operational layer of this project.  
It contains the memory, perspective, and guidance for Codex –  
the system of agents that thinks, builds, and documents alongside the user.

This is not metadata.  
This is part of the system.

---

## Purpose

Codex is not a tool you prompt.  
Codex is a team you lead.

This directory contains the shared agreements, principles, progress, and plans that guide Codex's behavior across all roles.  
It allows Codex to remember **why** a system exists – not just what it does.

---

## Structure

- `AGENTS.md` – this file: the team, its mindset, and how it operates
- `policy.md` – rules of engagement: what this project values and enforces
- `progress.md` – an ongoing log of decisions, changes, and agent activity
- `direction.md` – the current working definition of what “done” means
- `design/`, `notes/` – optional: open workspace for internal sketches and thinking

---

## Principle

If a system doesn’t remember **why** it exists,  
it will forget **how** to grow.

This folder ensures it doesn’t.
