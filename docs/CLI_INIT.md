  will utilize npm/npx.

# Codex-Hive CLI [STUB]


This repository includes a minimal script to scaffold a new Codex-based project.

```
cli/init.sh <target-directory>
```

The script copies the `codex/` and `docs/` folders, along with `README.md`, into the target directory. Use it when you want a quick starting point.

After running the script:

1. Review `codex/direction.md` in the new project and adjust it to your needs.
2. Update `README.md` to explain your specific goals.
3. Start logging changes to `codex/progress.md` as you build.

The CLI is intentionally lightweight. Expand or replace it to fit your workflow.
