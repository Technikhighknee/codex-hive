# Codex-Hive CLI


This repository includes a Node-based initializer you can run with npm:

```
npm create codex-hive@latest <target-directory>
```

The initializer copies the `codex/` and `docs/` folders, along with `README.md`, into the target directory. Use it when you want a quick starting point.

After running the script:

1. Review `codex/direction.md` in the new project and adjust it to your needs.
2. Update `README.md` to explain your specific goals.
3. Start logging changes to `codex/progress.md` as you build.

The CLI is intentionally lightweight. Expand or replace it to fit your workflow.
