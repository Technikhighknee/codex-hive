# Responsible Use of Codex-Hive

Codex-Hive is designed to help humans coordinate language model agents. It is **not** an autonomous system.

Follow these guidelines to keep your project safe and transparent:

1. **Human Oversight** – Review all agent output before it becomes part of your repository or product. Codex does not replace human judgment.
2. **Document Changes** – Log every meaningful action in `codex/progress.md`. Lack of history makes audits impossible.
3. **Check for Risks** – When introducing new prompts, data sources, or automation, involve the `Guardian` role to assess potential issues.
4. **Respect Privacy** – Do not store sensitive personal data in this repository unless you have explicit consent and clear retention policies.
5. **Stay Within Scope** – If the project direction changes drastically, update `codex/direction.md` and review all policies.

Codex-Hive provides structure, but you remain responsible for how it is used.
