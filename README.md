# codex-hive

A starter environment for building **role-aware** systems with OpenAI Codex. This repository contains the structure, policies, and documentation needed to spin up a new project where Codex operates as a team of agents.

Codex-hive does not run code for you. It provides the scaffolding so humans can direct Codex safely and transparently.

---

## What This Is

- A set of agent roles that define how Codex collaborates
- Shared policies and direction files to keep projects intentional
- Example documents and progress tracking
- A template you can copy or fork when creating your own Codex-based repo

## What This Is Not

- An automated product or finished application
- A replacement for human oversight
- An official OpenAI project

---

## Repository Overview

- `codex/` – policies, direction, and memory for the agents
- `codex/roles/` – individual role definitions
- `docs/` – human-facing guides and examples (see `docs/ONBOARDING.md`)
- `LICENSE.lic` – released under the Unlicense

Use `docs/direction.example.md` as inspiration for your own project direction. Log every meaningful change to `codex/progress.md` as you build.
